Assignment-5.1 - Will the Customer Accept the Coupon? Readme

Overview: This is a academic exercise exploring visualizations, probability distributions and data analyss. This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The goal of this project is demonstarte the ability to visulalize data and work with probability distributions to distinguish between customer groups.


Summary: Python was used in conjunction with pandas and seaborn library to analyze and visual coupon acceptance data for various customer groups. Variables such as income level, occupation, gender and eating habits were included and exaimed to find trends, problem areas and potential areas for improvement with income and occupation being the main focus of my analysis. The data was visualized using a range a graph types. 


Key Finding: There is a dip in both coupon acceptance rate and total coupons in those making between $62.5k and $100k while a very strong positive trend at $100k+. In researching where coupons were being most successful in those making over $100k, it was found that people with the occupation of "Computer and Mathmatical" were an effective group to market to. 


Next Steps: It is worth exploring if more coupons should be offered to people with the occupation of "Computer and Mathmatical" in the $62.5k and $100k income range in order to boost activity in that cohort.
